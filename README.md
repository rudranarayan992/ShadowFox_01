## 🧪 Task List

### ✅ Task 1: Variable `pi` and Its Data Type
- **Description:**  
  A variable named `pi` is created and assigned the value `22/7`.  
  The data type of `pi` is then checked using the `type()` function.

- **File:** `Task_1.py`

### ❌ Task 2: Using Reserved Keyword as Variable
- **Description:**  
  An attempt is made to create a variable named `for` and assign it a value `4`.  
  This raises a `SyntaxError` because `for` is a reserved keyword in Python.

- **File:** `Task_2.py`

- **Note:** Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.

### 📈 Task 3: Simple Interest Calculation
- **Description:**  
  This task calculates simple interest using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
  \]  
  Where:
  - `P` is the Principal amount
  - `R` is the Rate of interest
  - `T` is the Time in years

- **File:** `Task_3.py`
